# Is Wayland ready in 2022?

## Web browsers

‚úÖ Yes!

* Firefox, by default
* Chrome, since around Chrome 91 / May 2021, with a [flag](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1085700):
`google-chrome-stable --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland &`


## Screensharing

‚úÖ Yes!

See my answer for [Screen sharing with Wayland](https://askubuntu.com/a/1398720/220798) on AskUbuntu.

## Custom keyboard layout

While one was able to set a custom keybord layout from command-line in X11 using `xkbcomp` and `setxkbmap`, for Wayland the existing XKB tools were split-forked from X and refactored into libxkbcommon, which mainstream compositors directly embed.

Luckily libxkbcommon 0.10.0 (Jan2020) and 1.0.0 (Sep2020) improve things, as explained by Peter Hutterer in a great 4-part blog series [User-specific XKB configuration](https://web.archive.org/web/20210828193033/https://who-t.blogspot.com/2020/09/user-specific-xkb-configuration-putting.html).

See the libxkbcommon [User-configuration](https://xkbcommon.org/doc/current/md_doc_user_configuration.html) doc.

üó≤ TODO: try! 

Also, the [pre-supplied <i>custom</i> keyboard layout](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303023436/https://who-t.blogspot.com/2021/02/a-pre-supplied-custom-keyboard-layout.html) in xkeyboard-config 2.33 works in both Wayland and X11. In Ubuntu 22.04:

## Automation

### Input-centric

* ‚úÖ [Hawck](https://github.com/snyball/Hawck) key-rebinding daemon with lua scripting (root!)

* ‚úÖ KWin Custom shortcuts can input text

* üï± Tools like xmodmap, xbindkeys don't work with Wayland, but feature-set is arguably covered by the above.

* ‚è≥ Mouse-sharing support between devices or VMs: coming soon? See [barrier#109](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/109#issuecomment-1049479068)

* ‚è≥ Global keyboard shortcut portal [xdg-desktop-portal#624](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/624)


### Scripting

* ‚úÖ Compositor-specific tools, like KWin scripts and gnome-shell extensions (both in JavaScript).

* ‚ùå Tools like xdotool, or [autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) don't work with Wayland.

* ‚ùå GUI-agnostic "screen-scraping" tool [SikuliX](https://sikulix.github.io/), could be adapted to use the screen-sharing portal.

## Toolkits

### Qt in Gnome

‚úÖ Yes with setup. By default 
* Qt apps start with X and *`Warning: Ignoring XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland on Gnome. Use QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland to run on Wayland anyway.`*
Workaround with `` in `~/.profile`
* They look bad, especially when using GTK4 Adwaita-dark, and the default `qt5-gtk-platformtheme` makes it worse. I went with the default KDE look doing the following:
```bash
sudo apt remove qt5-gtk-platformtheme
sudo apt install breeze plasma-integration
# in ~/.profile:
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=kde
```

## Other

* Middle-mouse paste - ‚úÖ yes! at least between wayland apps.
* Focus stealing - ‚ùå
    * KDE should have [Full xdg_activation_v1 support](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/issues/39) but apps do not support it:
    * [Previously opened Firefox window is not focused when opening a link from other applications](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1766269).
    * Chromium [wayland: Support window activation via standard extensions](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1175327)
