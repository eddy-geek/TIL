## Old style - mp3+G

This format has the lyrics with timing, and opssibly some video or animation.

But it does not have the notes to sing, necessary to know if you sing it right and have "gamification" (scores).

# UltraStar

Here you have the actual notes in a master TXT file that also links the mp3 mandatory) and video (optional).

The format is an evolution of SingStar and can convert its files.
