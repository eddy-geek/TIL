LG 27UD58-B supports HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.2

* "HDMI 2.0 increases the maximum bandwidth to 18.0 Gbit/s" and can **"carry 4K video at 60 Hz with 24 bit/px color depth"** ([HDMI - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI))
* DP 1.2 supports "doubling of the data rate to 17.28 Gbit/s in High Bit Rate 2 (HBR2) mode" and **"3840 × 2160 at 60 Hz 10 bpc RGB"** ([DisplayPort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort))

Yet for some reason Linux refuses to display at more than 30Hz unless resolution is dropped to eg 1440p. This was tested through the dock, and with the LG USB-C to HDMI cable.

It lists "3840 × 2160 at 24, 25, and 30 Hz" which happens to be HDMI 1.4.
